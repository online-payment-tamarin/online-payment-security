/*
Description:
    Lemma checks if the transaction amount ever reaches the client (so the client is informed).
    If it does, then the transaction amount must be the same as the one in Processor_handles_transaction(), otherwise
    it means that the client might be charged a different amount than indicated

Result:
    Fails -> it is formally guaranteed that the amount received by the client is also the one in the transaction
    Holds -> there is no guarantee that the amount shown to the client is the one used in the final transaction
